## Hi there.
Iâ€™m Wiebke, a Full Stack Web Developer and UI/UX designer ðŸ‘‹  

The web has amazed me ever since I typed my first lines of HTML on the familyâ€™s 1024Ã—768 computer screen in the 90s. After 15+ years in the industry, the excitement hasnâ€™t stopped. While I am primarily focusing on Full Stack Development right now (MERN, React, etc.), UI/UX Design remains close to my heart.  

Usability is a top priority in my work and I am also strongly advocating for (and keep learning about) web accessibility.

Have a look at my projects below. ðŸ‘‡ And hey, [letâ€™s connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fraulueneburg/)
