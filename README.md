## Hi there.
Iâ€™m Wiebke, a Full Stack Web Developer and UI/UX designer ðŸ‘‹  

The web has amazed ever since I typed my first lines of HTML on my familyâ€™s 1024Ã—768 computer screen in the 90s. Having been in the industry for 15+ years now, the excitement hasnâ€™t stopped. While I am primarily focusing on Development work right now (MERN, React, etc.), UI/UX remains close to my heart.  

Usability is a top priority for me and I am also strongly advocating for (and keep learning about) web accessibility.

ðŸ‘‡ Have a look at my projects below
