## Hi there.
Iâ€™m Wiebke, a Full Stack Web Developer and UI/UX designer ðŸ‘‹  
The web has amazed ever since I typed my first lines of HTML on my familyâ€™s 1024Ã—768 computer screen in the 90s. Having been in the industry for 15+ years now, the excitement hasnâ€™t stopped. Looking for a new challenge in 2023, I recently made the switch from Frontend to Full Stack. While I am primarily focusing on Development work right now, UI/UX still remains close to my heart.  

Building amazing easy-to-use products that add value to their usersâ€™ lives, is what I love most.  
I have always had a large focus on usability and am also strongly advocating for (and keep learning about) web accessibility.

ðŸ‘‡ Have a look at my projects below
